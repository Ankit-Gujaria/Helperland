            A cleaner is a type of industrial or domestic worker who cleans homes or commercial premises for payment.
             Cleaners may specialise in cleaning particular things or places, such as window cleaners. Cleaners often
              work when the people who otherwise occupy the space are not around. They may clean offices at night or 
              houses during the workday.
